#  Moonshot

This app details some of the history behind NASAâ€™s Apollo space program.

I made this project to improve my knowledge in iOS development, specially SwiftUI.

I learned how to:

- Resize images to fit the screen using GeometryReader
- How to use ScrollView with scrolling data
- Push new views onto the stack using NavigationLink
- Work with hierarchical Codable data
- Load a specific kind of Codable data
- Use generics to load any kind of Codable data

This app was made using the course **100 Days of SwiftUI** from [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/)
